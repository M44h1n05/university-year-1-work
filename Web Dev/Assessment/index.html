                    Percy Jackson is having a bad week. His life has gone from totally normal to monsters-from-Greek-mythology-randomly-appearing kind of strange. Worse still, the king of the gods thinks Percy has stolen his all-powerful lightning bolt - and it seems making Zeus angry is a very bad idea.
                    Now Percy and his friends have just ten days to catch the true lightning thief and stop all-out war from erupting on Mount Olympus.
